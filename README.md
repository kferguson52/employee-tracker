# employee-tracker

## This application utillize NPM inquirer via the command line and a MySQL Database. I have built the first series of questions, and the function to query the existing database for the first question selected. I believe the query is taking too long to be called and showing the database with the console.table functionality. I think if I could get past that piece, it would be quick to complete the rest of the prompts. Submitting for class credit.
